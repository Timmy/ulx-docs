## Introduction

ULX allows for a high level of customization. Most settings can be changed from XGUI by typing `!xgui settings` in chat.

Settings that are not customizable in XGUI are covered on this page.

## Downloads

| File    | `<garrysmod>/data/ulx/downloads.txt`                |
| Format  | Flat-file database                                  |
| Purpose | Files and directories that clients should download. |

Forced downloads allow you to specify paths to files and directories that should be downloaded by the client.

## Per-gamemode or per-map configuration

ULX can load different configurations depending on the current gamemode or map.

Create files using the following folder structure:
- `<garrysmod>/data/ulx/maps/<mapname>/config.txt`
- `<garrysmod>/data/ulx/gamemodes/<gamemodename>/config.txt`

This feature is compatible with all ULX configuration files (`config.txt`, `downloads.txt`, `gimps.txt`, `adverts.txt`, `votemaps.txt`, `banreasons.txt`, `motd.txt` and `banmessage.txt`).

All configurations add to each other except gimps and votemaps, which takes the most specific configuration only.
